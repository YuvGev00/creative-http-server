# ⚒ Forge

A small, expressive HTTP/1.1 web framework built **entirely from scratch** on
Node.js's low-level `net` module — no `http`, `http2`, or third-party HTTP
libraries. Only Node built-ins are used: `net`, `fs`, `path`, and `crypto`
(the last solely for the WebSocket accept-key hash).

## Quick start

```bash
node examples/demo.js      # or: npm start
# → http://localhost:3000
# → http://localhost:3000/_routes   (live API reference)

node test/smoke.js         # or: npm test  (28 assertions, raw-socket driven)
```

## API design choices

I chose an **Express-flavoured, chainable core** so the framework is instantly
familiar and easy to evaluate against the requirements, then added **four
cohesive creative features** that build naturally on top of it: typed routes
with auto-validation + live docs, a request Flight Recorder, hand-rolled
WebSockets, and a Streaming Lab (chunked transfer + Server-Sent Events) —
all on the same raw `net` sockets.

### Core API

```js
const forge = require('./src/server');
const app = forge();

app.use((req, res, next) => { console.log(req.method, req.path); next(); });

app.get('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ id: req.params.id });          // params, query, headers, body
});

app.post('/api/echo', (req, res) => {
  res.status(201).json(req.body);           // chainable status().json()
});

app.static('./public');                     // static files, like express.static()

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('up'));
```

- **Request** — `req.method`, `req.path`, `req.query`, `req.params`,
  `req.headers`, `req.body` (lazily parsed as JSON / urlencoded / text by
  `Content-Type`), `req.rawBody`, `req.ip`.
- **Response** — chainable `status()`, `set()`, `type()`, `json()`, `send()`,
  `redirect()`, `sendFile()` (streamed, correct MIME + `Content-Length`).
- **Router** — `:param` and trailing `*` wildcard patterns; routes matched in
  registration order by method + path;
  `app.use(fn)` / `app.use('/prefix', fn)` middleware running in registration
  order with `next()`; automatic `404` and `500` fallbacks.
- **Static** — virtual mount paths, directory `index.html`, MIME inference,
  and **directory-traversal protection** (resolved path must stay inside the
  served root, checked before any filesystem access).

### Creative feature 1 — Typed routes with auto-validation + a live, self-updating API reference

`app.route({ ... })` registers a route with a **declarative body schema**. The
framework validates `req.body` automatically and short-circuits with a
structured `400` before your handler runs — you never write validation
boilerplate:

```js
app.route({
  method: 'POST',
  path: '/api/users',
  description: 'Create a user.',
  body: {
    name:  { type: 'string', required: true, min: 2, max: 40 },
    email: { type: 'string', required: true, pattern: /^[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.[^@\s]+$/ },
    role:  { type: 'string', enum: ['admin', 'member'] },
  },
  handler: (req, res) => res.status(201).json({ created: true }),
});
```

Invalid request → automatic, descriptive response:

```json
{ "error": "Validation failed",
  "details": [ { "field": "email", "message": "\"email\" is required" } ] }
```

Because every route carries its schema as metadata, the framework serves a
**live API reference** at `GET /_routes` — a styled HTML page (or
`?format=json`) generated directly from the registered routes, so the docs can
never drift from the implementation.

### Creative feature 2 — Request Flight Recorder

A bounded in-memory ring buffer captures the lifecycle of recent requests —
which middleware ran and for how long, whether typed-route validation passed
or failed, handler timing, final status and response size. It is exposed as a
live, auto-refreshing timeline at `GET /_trace` (and `?format=json`). This is
framework-level observability: you can *watch* a request flow through the
middleware chain and handler, not just see the final response.

### Creative feature 3 — Hand-rolled WebSockets on raw `net`

`app.ws('/path', (conn) => …)` registers a WebSocket endpoint. The full
**RFC 6455** handshake (SHA-1 + magic GUID accept key — verified against the
spec's own published test vector) and the frame codec (client unmasking,
text/binary/ping/pong/close opcodes, 16- and 64-bit lengths) are implemented
**from the specification** over the same raw `net` sockets — no `ws` library,
no `http` server. The demo wires this into a broadcast chat (`/chat.html`,
open it in two tabs). `crypto` is used only for the accept-key hash; the
assignment forbids `http`/`http2`, not `crypto`.

```js
const clients = new Set();
app.ws('/chat', (conn) => {
  clients.add(conn);
  conn.on('message', (m) => { for (const c of clients) c.send(m); });
  conn.on('close', () => clients.delete(conn));
});
```

### Creative feature 4 — Streaming Lab: chunked transfer + Server-Sent Events

Two more real-time HTTP mechanisms, hand-built on the same raw sockets and
shown side by side at `/streaming-lab.html`:

- **`res.chunked()`** opens a response with `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` and
  no `Content-Length`, then writes each frame by hand
  (`<hex size>\r\n<data>\r\n`, terminated by the `0\r\n\r\n` chunk). The demo
  page **visibly assembles itself** as chunks arrive — open DevTools › Network
  to watch the handcrafted framing.
- **`res.sse()`** holds a `text/event-stream` connection open and pushes named
  events the browser's native `EventSource` consumes — one-way real-time over
  plain HTTP, distinct from the WebSocket path.

Together with the WebSocket support this covers the **full spectrum of HTTP
real-time delivery** (full-duplex WS, one-way SSE, progressive chunked) — all
implemented from the wire format up.

## How it works under the hood

1. **TCP, not HTTP.** `net.createServer` gives raw sockets. A single `'data'`
   event is *not* one HTTP request — TCP delivers arbitrary byte chunks.
2. **Per-socket buffering** (`src/server.js` + `src/http-parser.js`): bytes are
   accumulated in a `Buffer`; a request is dispatched only once the header
   terminator `\r\n\r\n` **and** the full `Content-Length` body have arrived.
   Operating on Buffers keeps binary/non-ASCII bodies intact. The
   `test/smoke.js` "split request" case writes one request in two TCP chunks to
   prove this works — the naive "one data event = one request" approach (as in
   the assignment's reference snippets) fails this.
3. **Manual parsing**: request line → method/target/version, query string,
   lower-cased headers, body slice.
4. **Manual response building**: `HTTP/1.1 <code> <text>\r\n`, headers
   (auto `Content-Length`, `Date`, `Server`, `Connection: close`), blank line,
   body.

```

## Verification

`npm test` boots the framework on an ephemeral port and drives it with a raw
`net` client (28 assertions), covering: JSON routes, path params,
valid/invalid typed-route validation, static MIME, traversal blocking, the
live docs (HTML + JSON), a split-across-TCP-chunks request, 404 handling,
hardening cases — malformed/conflicting `Content-Length`, rejected chunked
encoding, wildcard routes, `HEAD` no-body, CRLF header-injection, `send()`
with an object, double-`next()`, NUL-byte paths, oversized-body `413` — plus
the creative features: the Flight Recorder timeline, a full WebSocket
handshake + masked-frame round-trip checked against the RFC 6455 test vector,
and byte-level checks of the chunked-transfer and SSE framing.

## Possible extensions (out of scope here)

HTTP keep-alive connection reuse, TLS/HTTPS, HTTP/2, chunked
transfer-encoding, `multipart/form-data`, and cookie/session support.
